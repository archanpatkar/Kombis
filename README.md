# Combino
### A DSL Compiler for Combinatory Logic based on the universal formal system SKI Combinator Calculus

## Background
Combinatory logic is a notation to eliminate the need for quantified variables in **mathematical logic**. It was introduced by **Moses SchÃ¶nfinkel** and **Haskell Curry**, and has more recently been used in computer science as a **theoretical model of computation** and also as a basis for the design of **functional programming languages**.

SKI Combinator Calculus is a **combinatory logic**, a **Computational System** or **Model of Computation** which may be perceived as reduced version of **untyped lambda calculus**. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. Instead, it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple Turing complete language.

## Implementation
Combino can be used as a **Embedded DSL** inside of Javascript using **Tagged String Templates**(*Macros*). The DSL completly supports **SKI Combinator Calculus Grammer** which is then **transformed** or **compiled** into **Javascript - ES6** this transformation is applied using a, **Tag** on **String Template** which will contain the Combino/SKI **Code**. Combino allows to write very complicated functional hybird **SKI** compositions which allows **infusion** of Javascript with **SKI Combinator Calculus** in a **concise** manner. Complex **Compositions** and **Representations** are easier to write in Combino rather than native Javascript

## Usage

#### `Compilation (to Javascript)`
```javascript
let compiled = combc`...`
```

#### `Compilation and Execution`
```javascript
let output = combi`...`
```

## Examples
### Encoding TRUE
```javascript
combi`(K)`
```

### Encoding FALSE
```javascript
combi`(SK)`
```

### Using Custom Primitive Values in conjunction with Combino
```javascript
combi`((K(I #${false})(I(I #${10}))))`
```
### Recursion
> This will lead to Infinite Recursion ðŸ’£

Recursion in **SKI Combinator Calculus** and **Lambda Calculus** is achieved by Fixed-point combinators and
the infamous **Y Combinator** discovered by **Haskell Curry** 

There are two ways to encode it

#### `Variant 1`(Good for understanding)

Derivation 1
```
S(KÎ±)(SII)(S(KÎ±)(SII))
= KÎ±(S(KÎ±)(SII))(SII(S(KÎ±)(SII)))
= Î±(S(KÎ±)(SII)(S(KÎ±)(SII)))
= Î±(Î±(S(KÎ±)(SII)(S(KÎ±)(SII))))
= Î±(Î±(Î±(S(KÎ±)(SII)(S(KÎ±)(SII)))))
= ...
```

Derivation 2
```
Î² = S(KÎ±)(SII)
SIIÎ² 
= Î²Î²
= (S(KÎ±)(SII))Î² 
= KÎ±Î²(SIIÎ²) 
= Î±(SIIÎ²) 
= Î±(Î²Î²)
= Î±(Î±(Î²Î²))
= Î±(Î±(Î±(Î²Î²)))
= ...
```

Combino Code
```javascript
combi`(S(K #${(x)=>10})(SII)(S(K #${(x)=>10})(SII)))`
```

#### `Variant 2`(Standard Way and Easy to use)
```javascript
combi`(S(K(SII))(S(S(KS)K)(K(SII)))#${x => 10})`
```

#### `Variant 3`(Built-in)
```javascript
combi`(Y #${x => 10})`
```
