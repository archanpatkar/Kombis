# Combino
### A Compiler / DSL for Combinatory Logic based on the universal formal system SKI Combinator Calculus

## Background
Combinatory logic is a notation to eliminate the need for quantified variables in **mathematical logic**. It was introduced by **Moses Sch√∂nfinkel** and **Haskell Curry**, and has more recently been used in computer science as a **theoretical model of computation** and also as a basis for the design of **functional programming languages**.

SKI Combinator Calculus is a **combinatory logic**, a **Computational System** or **Model of Computation** which may be perceived as reduced version of **untyped lambda calculus**. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. Instead, it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple Turing complete language.

## Implementation
Combino can be used as a **Embedded DSL** inside of Javascript using **Tagged String Templates**. The DSL completly supports **SKI Combinator Calculus Grammer** which is then **transformed** or **compiled** into **Javascript/[ES6]/**(Arrow Functions) this transformation is applied using a **Tag** on **String Template** which will contain the Combino/SKI Code. 

## Examples
**Encoding TRUE**
```javascript
combi`(K)`
```

**Encoding FALSE**
```javascript
combi`(SK)`
```

**Using Custom Primitive Values in conjunction with Combino**
```javascript
combi`((K(I #${false})(I(I #${10}))))`
```
