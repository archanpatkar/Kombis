# Combino
### A DSL for Combinatory Logic based on the universal formal system SKI Combinator Calculus

## Introduction
Combinatory logic is a notation to eliminate the need for quantified variables in **mathematical logic**. It was introduced by **Moses Sch√∂nfinkel** and **Haskell Curry**, and has more recently been used in computer science as a **theoretical model of computation** and also as a basis for the design of **functional programming languages**.

SKI Combinator Calculus is a **combinatory logic**, a **Computational System** or **Model of Computation** which may be perceived as reduced version of **untyped lambda calculus**. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. Instead, it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple Turing complete language.
